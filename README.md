## Description

Welcome to the hackathon!  This event aims to jumptstart developers on Arm-based HPC systems.  It's a fairly unstructured, non-competitive event that combines talks, application guided tours, and open time for hacking.  See [the event home page](https://arm-hpc-user-group.github.io/SC21-Hackathon/) for the schedule and further details.

## Codes

This repo contains examples and scripts to help you get started quickly.  
 * `env`: bash environment scripts that load known-good compilers, libraries, and tools into your user environment.
 * `examples`: A complete suite of examples for compilers, libraries, emulators, profilers, and debuggers for Arm systems that implement SVE.  
 * `applications`: Worked example applications from the hackathon.  

### Contributing
