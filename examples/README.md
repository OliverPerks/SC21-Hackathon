# Arm SVE Tools Tutorial

This tutorial will introduce all the tools an HPC developer might need when
targeting an Arm-based server-class CPU with SVE, such as the Fujitsu A64FX 
or the Arm V1. The tutorial is organized into _modules_ in directories named 
XX_MODULE_NAME.  Each module focues on a single tool or concept.  The modules 
may be taken in any order, but modules may reference content or concepts 
introduced in modules with a lower number.  Each module has its own README.md 
file that will help you get started.

Have fun!
